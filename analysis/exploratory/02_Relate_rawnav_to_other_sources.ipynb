    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces how the `wmatarawnav` package and methods developed for the WMATA Analysis of Fine-Grained Bus AVL to Evaluate Queue Jump Effectiveness study (Queue Jump Effectiveness study) can be used to relate WMATA ranwav data to other data sources such as intersections, stops, or evaluation segments. These associated datasets can then be used with the rawnav data for further analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "As before, code for this project exists in two general forms:\n",
    "1. **Code usable for any analysis of rawnav data.** Functions for relating rawnav data to other sources are contained in the in-development Python package `wmatarawnav`.\n",
    "2. **Code specific to the Queue Jump Effectiveness study**. This code contains project-specific steps to relate rawnav data to other data using functions in the `wmatarawnav` package along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, code usable for any analysis of rawnav data are illustrated using the custom functions contained in the `wmatarawnav` package. The actual process used for the Queue Jump Effectiveness study will differ slightly in form, but still makes use of these general steps.\n",

    "## 1. Rawnav Data Management and Processing Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The `wmatarawnav` approach to processing rawnav data is based on several key design considerations, but is agnostic towards how data is stored and otherwise managed. This section will briefly discuss these design choices for those who may use the `wmatarawnav` codebase for later analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The rawanv parsing functions discussed in *Introduction to parsing rawnav data with `wmatarawnav`* ultimately produce two tables: a table of rawnav 'pings' for individual bus runs and a summary table that provides an aggregate summary of those runs. These tables could be uploaded to a database for further analysis, visualized using Tableau, or used in myriad other ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Queue Jump Effectiveness study, these tables are stored as a [Parquet-format file](https://databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet#:~:text=Parquet%20is%20an%20open%20source,like%20CSV%20or%20TSV%20files.&text=Parquet%20can%20only%20read%20the%20needed%20columns%20therefore%20greatly%20minimizing%20the%20IO.), which allows for fast retrieval and compact storage of large datasets on a local device. One can consider it analogous to a CSV that is compressed and structured for improved retrieval of chunks of data partitioned on a key field (such as a route identifier). While the use of this format is not required for the rawnav functions, we recommend it as a storage mechanism over alternatives like a database or CSV export for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Many rawnav traveltime decomposition functions require the processing of all runs of a particular route in a study period.** For instance, to calculate the free flow speed over a segment, the 95th percentile speeds of all runs are needed. This requires rawnav runs to be analyzed in bulk, rather than using SQL database `SELECT` `FROM` `WHERE`-style commands to filter to a particular set of runs. Parquet loads data faster than CSV or a remote database, especially if only select columns or partitions are needed.\n",
    "2. **The rawnav traveltime decomposition approach described in the next section does not require successive updates to the source rawnav data**. In this way, the utility of a database for read-write operations is less necessary. Moreover, the use of saved flat files in Parquet also helps to improve the reproducibility of an analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several downsides to the use of Parquet to briefly address: until the summer of 2020, it was not suited to storing geospatial data (relative to an alternative like PostgreSQL with PostGIS). Collaborative work with this data would require very large datasets to be hosted on a shared drive in a way that may be less practical than a database. The format is also less suited to successive additions of data like a database, though the partitioning structure of the data can be updated to address this shortcoming. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Because rawnav data is large and spatial in nature, thoughtful approaches are needed to make working with the data time efficient and user friendly. The `wmatarawnav` processing code relies on an approach centered around \"chunking\" and sets of index and summary tables to make this approach user friendly. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "While rawnav data is large (all October 2019 data is approximately 10 GB compressed), it is not excessively large. Distributed data-processing methods such as Spark are note needed, and once the set of data is reduced to a set of routes, it is also not large enough to require parallel processing methods such as Dask. In particular, parallel processing adds additional processing overhead that could slow analyses of smaller sets of data in the future, and are not always suited to geospatial operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the Queue Jump Effectiveness project relies on an approach that breaks the data into smaller chunks by route and then by day of week to perform operations in memory using standard Python approaches with the libraries like Pandas and Geopandas. This approach is likely to be slower for processing data for the set of routes in the Queue Jump Effectiveness project, but reduces the time needed to write and tune code and will make later ad-hoc analyses using the `wmatarawnav` codebase faster. The decision to iterate by day of week is arbitrary, but helps to make the size of data kept in memory smaller and more readily permits the exclusion of weekends or Mondays and Fridays from an analysis. Chunking by date may be another appropriate approach, but creating chunks that are too small can slow the process of working with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Index and Summary Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing a month's worth of rawnav data for 15 WMATA routes may take up to six hours. Additional modifications to stored rawnav data would require additional write time and potentially create copies of the data that would be burdensome to store in memory or on disk. \n",

    "Rawnav data indicates the route (e.g., \"79\") and pattern, a two-digit string typically beginning with \"0\" (e.g., \"01\", \"02\", \"03\", \"04\"), and a stop identifier (e.g., \"E01\", \"E02\"). These route and pattern identifiers match indicators in Trapeze, WMATA's scheduling software. Using a schedule data export from Trapeze in the form of an Access Database, we can relate other information about a pattern to our rawnav data. This can be useful for associating identifying information to a run (e.g., does pattern \"01\" correspond to a north- or south-bound trip for Route 79?) as well as for associating known Stop IDs and stop names to the stop identifiers that appear in the rawnav data. While the stop indicators in rawnav data indicate a stop sequence (e.g., \"E01\" appears as the first stop in any rawnav run), rawnav stops are matched to stops in the schedule database through geoprocessing rather by matching the stop sequence in a particular pattern. This also serves as a check on the accuracy of rawnav data relative to stop locations. Strictly speaking, this step is not needed to make use of and analyse rawnav data, but adding these additional identifiers can be useful in the data cleaning and analysis process. If a schedule database is not available, a lookup table could be created in a format shown below that relates route, pattern, stop identifiers, and stop locations.\n",
